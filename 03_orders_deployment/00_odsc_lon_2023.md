Abstract
--------
This half-day trading session covers several important Python topics and skills to apply AI and Machine Learning (ML) to Algorithmic Trading. The session shows how to make use of the Oanda trading API (via a demo account) to retrieve data, stream data, place orders, etc. Building on this, a ML-based trading strategy is formulated and backtested. Finally, the trading strategy is transformed into an online trading algorithm and is deployed for real-time trading on the Oanda trading platform.

Session Outline
---------------
1. Module: Setting up the Python and Oanda (paper) trading infrastructure
2. Module: Financial data logistics and backtesting of an ML-based algorithmic trading strategy
3. Module: Deployment of the ML-based algorithmic trading strategy in real-time
